In this vignette we use `starmie` to perform visualisation and inference
on a sequence of ADMIXTURE models fit on the [sample data](https://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/admixture/download.html)
supplied by the creators of ADMIXTURE. 

# Loading ADMIXTURE output and the 'admix' object

To begin we assume ADMIXTURE has been run on an example PED/BED file to analyse
and there is a directory containing the resulting .P, .Q and logging files
(if you want to perform inference). 

To read a single ADMIXTURE run first supply the names of .P and .Q file and save
it as an admix object using the `loadAdmixture` function.

```{r admix-read}
library(starmie)
# get Q and P files for K = 3
p3 <- system.file("extdata/hapmap3_files", "hapmap3.3.P", package = "starmie")
q3 <- system.file("extdata/hapmap3_files", "hapmap3.3.Q", package = "starmie")

k3_admix <- loadAdmixture(q3, p3)
k3_admix
```

Optionally, if you would like to look at model fit statstics you can read in
a log file as well. Now the admix object contains the estimated log-likelihood
and cross-validation error. 

```{r admix-log}
k3_log <- system.file("extdata/hapmap3_files", "log3.out", package = "starmie")

k3_admix <- loadAdmixture(q3, p3, k3_log)
k3_admix
```

In general an `admix` object consists of the following elements about a single
ADMIXTURE run:

```{r admix-object, echo=FALSE}
list_names <- names(k3_admix)
list_description <- c("K parameter supplied to ADMIXTURE",
                      "Number of samples",
                      "Number of markers",
                      "Individual ancestral probability of membership to cluster",
                      "Estimated ancestral allele frequencies for each cluster",
                      "Model fit statistics")

knitr::kable(data.frame(attributes = list_names, 
                        description = list_description))
```

## Constructing a barplot for a single admix object
The plotBar function works on `admix` objects and produces a facetted barplot
in the same manner as for `struct` objects.

```{r plotbar}
plotBar(k3_admix)
```

A regular barplot can be constructed by setting `facet = FALSE`.

```{r plotbar2}
plotBar(k3_admix, facet = FALSE)
```

## Putting admix objects together the `admixList` object

If you have tried running ADMIXTURE with many different values of $K$ then you
can use an `admixList` object to maninpulate them. To construct an `admixList`
object use `loadAdmixture` for each pair of Q and P files and then pass the
results to the `admixList` constructor function.

For example we have run ADMIXTURE on the sample data set with $K = 5$ using 
five-fold cross-validation.

```{r multirun}
admix_multi <- exampleAdmixture()
admix_multi
```

You can also plot multiple `admix` objects to see how cluster memberships change
for different values of $K$.

```{multiplot}
plotMultiK(admix_multi)
```

## Using ADMIXTURE output to perform inference.

The `bestK` method can be used to determine which value of `K` best explains
the observed data using an elbow plot on the cross-validation error.

```{r}
bestK(admix_multi)
```
